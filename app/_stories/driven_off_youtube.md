### Driven off YouTube by overzelous claims

_By [JessOkami](https://www.youtube.com/user/JessOkami)_

I am a staff member for a convention down in Hampton Roads, and one of our programs includes a karaoke contest. Many of our contestants like to have their song recorded to show friends and family later, but I can't post any of those anymore, because they will all be pulled immediately for one reason or another. It has gotten to the point that I can't even post the cosplay contests anymore either because something will cause them to be pulled, be it the costumes or a snippet of song. There was a brilliant performance in 2015 that I couldn't post because they made a reference to the Lion King, and I knew that would be pulled in a heart beat.

I don't make money off of my site. I only want to share my love for music and anime with more than my little corner of the world. But that's impossible I can't keep a thirty-second clip online for more than a few hours.
