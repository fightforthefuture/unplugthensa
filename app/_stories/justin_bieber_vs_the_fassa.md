### Justin Bieber: not a Belieber in Free Speech

_By [The Fassa](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheFassa)_

"I made a video criticising the Justin Bieber movie 'Believe' (Negatively, of course), and (according to the response I got) Bieber HIMSELF apparently took down the video."

"...I decided not to delete the video, since I knew that whatever parts I deleted wouldn't be enough. To this day, it's the only copyright claimer that I couldn't deal with. It leads me to another thing that bothers me about the YouTube copyright system: You're constantly left at the mercy of the claimer. To this day Bieber continues to get some small revenue off my video. And since I'm a small YouTuber, there's no way that I got to speak with the people there. It's simply ridiculous."
