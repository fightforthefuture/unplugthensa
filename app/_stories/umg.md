I've posted two YouTube videos in 2006 with couple songs by The Beatles. Then recently UMG_MK blocked my videos (fortunately didn't got a so-called dreadful copyright strike) the one is a tribute to the late Dan Curtis (aka the creator of "Dark Shadows") using The Beatles' "In My Life" and the late ABC News legend Peter Jennings (who died in 2005) using The Beatles' "Let it Be". Then, the Dan Curtis tribute video I did was blocked in some countries, and the Peter Jennings one blocked worldwide. I've tried to dispute this claim by using the FAIR USE thing

"Copyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the
Copyright Act of 1976, allowance is made for
"fair use" for purposes such as criticism,
comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship,
and research. Fair use is a use permitted by
copyright statue that might otherwise be
infringing. Non-profit, educational or
personal use tips the balance in favor of
fair use."

Guess what? TPTB at UMG_MK turned down my dispute and still have it blocked, and I was upset real bad so I did a YouTube rant about this nonsense. The link to the video is [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncox7dgrf7w](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncox7dgrf7w) as exhibit. UMG_MK are like internet vigilantes who are doing this witch hunt to get YouTube videos with actual recordings of songs by The Beatles removed and Fab Four related accounts suspended. I'm pretty fed up with this. I bet UMG_MK and Lucian Grainge's reputation will be tarnished if they heard this PR Nightmare plus John Lennon, George Harrison, manager Brian Epstein, and producer George Martin are rolling from their graves if they heard what UMG_MK did to The Beatles' tracks on YouTube. Royalties, Music Licensing, and Copyright is Broken, period! #WTFU? This is the last straw, it's time to put an end to UMG_MK's madness.
