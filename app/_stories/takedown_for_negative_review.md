title: 'DMCA Horror Stories: Copyright Takedown for Negative Review'
---
_By [Matthew Fernandez](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrXBfLZoMGnarK5jONgqPlw)_

A company called 5BP Games filed a takedown when I gave a negative review on an anime called Corpse Party Tortured Souls. Even though I had been well within fair use, they think they have the right to prohibit me from using their footage. I was also making a review for a movie called Cool cat saves the kids when Derek savage said he would be releasing personal info. I now have to live in fear of what would happen if I release the video. I want to live in a world were we can all live in a world that gives us freedom. Not a world were we are forced to say what business companies restrict us and lock us in the chains of censorship.
