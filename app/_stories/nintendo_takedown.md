I run a small Youtube channel with less than 50 subscribers. Less than 50 and I've still received 2 content ID claims. The first was from Nintendo. I talked about their E3 2015 press conference, and they claimed it for a clip I used (one they provided on the internet). I filed a response and it was refuted. No reason, no human interaction, no good explanation, even though my use of the clip was transformative. I didn't want to go further to receive a strike. Then, I received a claim for my Lord of the Rings: Two Towers Review literally SECONDS after I posted it. SECONDS! Now ads appear on the video on my channel which I really want to be ad - free! I used a clip to describe a scene from the movie, but apparently, that meant stealing content and stopping people from watching the movie which I told my viewers to watch. Anyway, that's my story. It's not as bad as many of the other content creators, but I'm surprised that huge companies care enough to give a channel with 39 subscribers(at the moment) ID claims.
